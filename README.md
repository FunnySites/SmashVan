# 🚐 The Smash Van

Welcome to **The Smash Van** – a parody website inspired by the absurdity of luxury “experience” businesses like the Mile High Club or Love Cloud. This site is purely for laughs and definitely not a real service... probably.

## 😎 What Is This?

A fake booking site for a mysterious and slightly questionable van experience. Choose your tier. Have some fun. Keep it classy.

## 🧠 Features

- Three totally ridiculous pricing tiers: Criminals, Raiders, and Kings.
- A beautiful hero section with a slogan to die for.
- A slideshow of majestic Smash Van moments.
- Fake customer testimonials (because real ones would be illegal).
- A “Book Now” button that goes nowhere (just like your dignity).
- Optional sound effect on page load (van door slam).
